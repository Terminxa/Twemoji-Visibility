**Twemojis In Minecraft**

This repository is not the place to download the up-to-date resource pack, go to [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/twemojis-in-minecraft) to download it. If you need to see the inside of the resource pack, download the .zip on Modrinth. You can post issues here though.
