Twemoji Visibility is a resource pack that replaces the standard Minecraft emojis with [Twemoji](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) emojis, the same ones that Twitter/X and Discord use.

## üìù Notes 
- There are multiple ways to paste in emojis.
	- On Windows: you can use Windows + . to open the emoji menu.
	- On MacOS: you can use Control + Command + Space to open the emoji menu.
	- You can also use mods such as [Symbol Type](https://modrinth.com/mod/symbol-chat) which feature their own emoji menu and other features.
- Sequence emojis are not supported by Minecraft, and by extension, this resource pack.
	- This means that some emojis will come out as multiple parts when attempted to type in.
	- Flags, skin tones, families, and some other emojis (such as üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è and üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ) do not work properly.
- Force Unicode Font must be disabled for emojis to be visible. 
	- Game Menu (Escape) > Options... > Language... > Font Settings... > Force Unicode Font (set to OFF).
- If you are using the DiscordSRV plugin on a server, set `EmojiBehavior` to `show` in the config.yml file to force all emojis sent in chat to display as their emoji and not the name.
	- You must be the host of the server, as you need access to the server itself to change this.
- The Beta version supports emojis on text that isn't white.
	- It is considered Beta because emojis may not render correctly in certain places. Please see the release notes to see what is broken.
