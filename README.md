Twemojis
-
Twemojis is a resource pack for Minecraft: Java Edition that displays [Twitter's Twemojis](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) when they are pasted into the chat. 

This resource pack wouldn't be possible without [Androkai](https://github.com/Androkai)'s [AndrosDiscordEmojis](https://github.com/Androkai/AndrosDiscordEmojis) resource pack, as this resource pack uses it as a base but adds the new unicode characters.

Notes:
- If you are on a Windows computer, you can press WIN + . to activate the emoji menu. This allows you to paste emojis without having to go on a website.
- If you are using an emoji with skin tone, they will display the skin tone as a second emoji.
	- This is a flaw with the game itself and cannot be fixed with a resource pack.
	- This also affects some other emojis, such as üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è(Face in Clouds Emoji)
- If you are using the DiscordSRV plugin and have this as a server resource pack, make sure to change the `EmojiBehavior` to  `show` in the config.yml file.
	- This changes all the default discord emojis to show in-game and not show the name of the emoji. This only works for built-in discord emojis, so server emojis won't be shown in game (but they will have their name like this: :emoji:)
- `Force Unicode` need to be disabled in the Language settings on the client for the emojis to be visible.
- If you want to paste emojis on signs, the color of the sign needs to be white.
	- If you are using a mod or plugin to color individual parts of the sign, that works too.
